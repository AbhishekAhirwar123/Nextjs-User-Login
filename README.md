This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Description

Project Title: User Authentication Pages
Description:
This GitHub repository contains two important components for user authentication in a web application â€“ the Signup Page and the Login Page. These pages are developed using modern web technologies and provide robust user authentication functionalities, including input validation and dynamic button states.

Features:
Signup Page:

Users can sign up by providing their username, email, phone number, and password.
Input validation ensures that all fields are correctly filled.
The Signup button is dynamically enabled or disabled based on the input.
Successful signups are communicated to the user, and they are redirected to the login page.
Login Page:

Existing users can log in using their email and password.
Input validation is implemented to ensure the required fields are not empty.
The Login button's state is updated dynamically.
Successful logins trigger a success message and a redirection to the user's profile page.
Technologies Used:
Front-end: React, Next.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
HTTP Requests: Axios
Notifications: React Hot Toast
Usage:
